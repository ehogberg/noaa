# noaa

NOAAs generated by Clojure.


## Pre-reqs

You'll need to have `leiningen` and `postgres` installed.



## Quick Start For The Very Impatient

	createdb noaa_dev
	git clone https://github.com/ehogberg/noaa
	cd $PROJECT_ROOT
	cp profiles.clj.example profiles.clj
	lein migratus
	lein run demo-noaas
		
A set of 10 NOAA-eligible mock leads will be generated into the `noaa_dev` db, which 
will then be identified as requiring NOAA generation, have messages generated for each 
and then "transmitted" to stdout.
